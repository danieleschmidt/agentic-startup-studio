# Code Review

## Static Analysis
- `ruff` reports no issues within `src/`.
- `bandit` flags one medium and two low severity findings: use of a broad `except` in the architecture analyzer and use of `xml.etree.ElementTree` in the testing helpers.

## Testing
- Individual acceptance tests pass when optional dependencies are installed, e.g. idea validation and coverage helpers.
- Full `pytest` run fails because many packages such as `fastapi`, `jinja2` and `sqlmodel` are not installed.

## Product Review
- Introduced an `Idea` model with category enumeration and sanitisation logic【F:src/agentic_startup_studio/idea.py†L1-L49】.
- Added a CLI command `validate` that checks idea data from either JSON or CLI parameters【F:src/agentic_startup_studio/cli.py†L12-L61】.
- Created helpers to run pytest with coverage and enforce a minimum percentage【F:src/agentic_startup_studio/testing.py†L11-L61】.
- Sprint board marks all unit testing tasks as done【F:SPRINT_BOARD.md†L1-L9】 but the development plan still lists them as incomplete【F:DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md†L6-L9】.

## Recommendations
1. Address the bandit findings by using `defusedxml` and avoiding bare excepts.
2. Align `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` with the sprint board to avoid confusion.
3. Provide instructions or scripts for installing optional dependencies so that the full test suite can run in CI.
4. Consider updating validators to Pydantic v2 style as indicated by the warnings during tests.
