## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### üö® Critical Vulnerabilities (Immediate Action Required)

For critical security issues that could lead to:
- Remote code execution
- Data breaches
- System compromise
- Authentication bypass

**DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue. Instead:

1. **Email**: Send details to `security@terragonlabs.com`
2. **Subject**: `[CRITICAL SECURITY] Brief description`
3. **Encryption**: Use our PGP key if possible (see below)
4. **Response**: We'll acknowledge within 4 hours

### üîí Standard Security Reports

For other security concerns:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use our private reporting feature
2. **Email**: `security@terragonlabs.com`
3. **Response Time**: Within 48 hours

## Security Response Process

### Timeline
- **Initial Response**: Within 4-48 hours depending on severity
- **Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix Development**: 1-14 days depending on complexity
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is deployed and users have time to update

### What to Include in Your Report

Please provide as much information as possible:

```
1. Vulnerability Description
   - Type of vulnerability
   - Impact assessment
   - Affected components

2. Reproduction Steps
   - Detailed steps to reproduce
   - Required conditions
   - Expected vs actual behavior

3. Technical Details
   - Code snippets (if applicable)
   - Configuration details
   - Environment information

4. Proof of Concept
   - Safe demonstration
   - Screenshots/logs
   - Video if helpful

5. Suggested Fix (Optional)
   - Proposed solution
   - Alternative approaches
   - Potential side effects
```

## Security Measures

### Application Security

#### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication with secure key rotation
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- API key authentication for service-to-service communication
- Session timeout and invalidation
- Multi-factor authentication support

#### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest using AES-256
- Encryption in transit using TLS 1.3
- Database encryption for sensitive fields
- Secure secret management with Google Cloud Secret Manager
- PII data handling compliance (GDPR, CCPA)

#### Input Validation & Sanitization
- Comprehensive input validation using Pydantic
- SQL injection prevention with parameterized queries
- XSS protection with output encoding
- CSRF protection for web interfaces
- File upload validation and scanning

#### API Security
- Rate limiting per user and endpoint
- Request/response logging and monitoring
- API versioning and deprecation policies
- CORS configuration
- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers

### Infrastructure Security

#### Container Security
- Minimal base images (distroless where possible)
- Regular vulnerability scanning with Trivy
- Non-root container execution
- Resource limits and security contexts
- Image signing and verification

#### Network Security
- Private networks for internal communication
- Firewall rules and security groups
- VPN access for administrative tasks
- Load balancer SSL termination
- Network segmentation

#### Secrets Management
- No secrets in code or configuration files
- Google Cloud Secret Manager integration
- Automatic secret rotation
- Secure secret distribution
- Audit logging for secret access

### Monitoring & Detection

#### Security Monitoring
- Real-time security event monitoring
- Anomaly detection for unusual patterns
- Failed authentication tracking
- Suspicious activity alerting
- Compliance monitoring dashboards

#### Incident Response
- 24/7 security monitoring
- Automated incident response playbooks
- Security incident escalation procedures
- Forensic data collection and analysis
- Communication protocols for breaches

## Security Best Practices for Developers

### Code Security
```python
# ‚úÖ Good: Use parameterized queries
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s", (user_id,))

# ‚ùå Bad: String concatenation
cursor.execute(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}")
```

### Secret Management
```python
# ‚úÖ Good: Use environment variables or secret manager
api_key = os.getenv("API_KEY")
secret = secret_manager.get_secret("db_password")

# ‚ùå Bad: Hardcoded secrets
api_key = "sk-1234567890abcdef"
```

### Input Validation
```python
# ‚úÖ Good: Use Pydantic models
class UserInput(BaseModel):
    email: EmailStr
    age: int = Field(ge=0, le=150)

# ‚ùå Bad: Direct user input
user_data = request.json  # No validation
```

## Security Tools and Automation

### Static Analysis
- **Bandit**: Python security linter
- **Safety**: Dependency vulnerability scanner
- **Semgrep**: SAST scanning
- **CodeQL**: GitHub security analysis

## PGP Key for Encrypted Communications

```
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
[Our PGP public key would be here]
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
```
