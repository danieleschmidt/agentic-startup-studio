# Terragon Autonomous SDLC Enhancement System

## Overview

The Terragon Autonomous SDLC Enhancement System provides perpetual value discovery and automated execution for advanced software repositories. This system continuously identifies, prioritizes, and executes the highest-value improvements to maintain optimal SDLC maturity.

## System Components

### 1. Value Discovery Engine (`value-discovery-engine.py`)

**Purpose**: Continuous identification and scoring of improvement opportunities

**Features**:
- Multi-source signal harvesting (git history, static analysis, security scans)
- Advanced scoring using WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First) + ICE + Technical Debt metrics
- Adaptive prioritization based on repository maturity level
- Comprehensive backlog generation with detailed metrics

**Usage**:
```bash
# Run discovery cycle
python3 .terragon/value-discovery-engine.py

# Run with custom output
python3 .terragon/value-discovery-engine.py --output custom-backlog.md
```

### 2. Autonomous Execution Scheduler (`autonomous-execution-scheduler.sh`)

**Purpose**: Automated execution of highest-value items with full SDLC integration

**Features**:
- Automatic branch creation and commit management
- Risk-assessed execution with rollback capabilities
- Comprehensive logging and metrics tracking
- Integration with existing CI/CD pipelines

**Usage**:
```bash
# Run full autonomous cycle
./.terragon/autonomous-execution-scheduler.sh

# Run discovery only
./.terragon/autonomous-execution-scheduler.sh discovery

# Execute specific item
./.terragon/autonomous-execution-scheduler.sh execute high-churn-analysis

# Check status
./.terragon/autonomous-execution-scheduler.sh status
```

### 3. Configuration System (`config.yaml`)

**Purpose**: Adaptive configuration for repository-specific optimization

**Key Settings**:
- Scoring weights optimized for advanced repositories
- Risk thresholds and execution parameters
- Tool integration configuration
- Business impact mapping

## Scoring Methodology

### Composite Score Calculation

```
Composite Score = (
  0.5 * Normalized_WSJF_Score +
  0.1 * Normalized_ICE_Score +
  0.3 * Normalized_Technical_Debt_Score +
  0.1 * Normalized_Security_Score
) * Category_Boost * 100
```

### WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First)
```
WSJF = Cost_of_Delay / Job_Size

Cost_of_Delay = (
  0.4 * Business_Impact +
  0.3 * Security_Impact + 
  0.2 * Technical_Debt_Impact +
  0.1 * Opportunity_Enablement
)
```

### ICE (Impact Confidence Ease)
```
ICE = Impact * Confidence * Ease
```

### Category Boosts
- **Security**: 2.0x multiplier
- **Compliance**: 1.8x multiplier  
- **Performance**: 1.5x multiplier

### Cron Integration
```bash
# Add to crontab for automated execution
*/60 * * * * cd /path/to/repo && ./.terragon/autonomous-execution-scheduler.sh discovery
0 2 * * *   cd /path/to/repo && ./.terragon/autonomous-execution-scheduler.sh
0 3 * * 1   cd /path/to/repo && ./.terragon/autonomous-execution-scheduler.sh
```
