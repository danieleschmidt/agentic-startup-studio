**WSJF Score: 7.2** | **Status: COMPLETED** | **Impact: CRITICAL**

- **Location:** `core/idea_ledger.py` and `tests/core/test_idea_ledger_error_handling.py`
- **Issue:** Database operations lacked proper error handling, risking application crashes
- **Implementation:** Comprehensive error handling with custom exceptions and logging
- **Business Value:** Prevents application crashes and data corruption (8/10)
- **Time Criticality:** Critical for production stability (8/10)
- **Risk Reduction:** Eliminates database operation failures (9/10)
- **Effort:** Moderate implementation complexity (4/10)

**Key Features Implemented:**

**Technical Improvements:**
```python
# Before: Basic operation with no error handling
def add_idea(idea_create: IdeaCreate) -> Idea:
    db_idea = Idea.model_validate(idea_create)
    with Session(engine) as session:
        session.add(db_idea)
        session.commit()
        session.refresh(db_idea)
    return db_idea

# After: Comprehensive error handling with logging
def add_idea(idea_create: IdeaCreate) -> Idea:
    try:
        db_idea = Idea.model_validate(idea_create)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Idea validation failed: {e}")
        raise IdeaValidationError(f"Invalid idea data: {e}") from e
    
    try:
        with Session(engine) as session:
            session.add(db_idea)
            session.commit()
            session.refresh(db_idea)
            logger.info(f"Successfully added idea with ID: {db_idea.id}")
            return db_idea
    except IntegrityError as e:
        logger.error(f"Database integrity constraint violation: {e}")
        raise IdeaValidationError(f"Idea data violates database constraints: {e}") from e
    except OperationalError as e:
        logger.error(f"Database connection error during idea creation: {e}")
        raise DatabaseConnectionError(f"Database connection failed: {e}") from e
    # ... additional error handling
```

**Technical Architecture:**
```python
# Advanced index creation with optimal parameters
async def _create_hnsw_index(self, conn: Connection, index_name: str) -> bool:
    index_sql = f"""
        CREATE INDEX {index_name} ON idea_embeddings 
        USING hnsw (description_embedding vector_cosine_ops)
        WITH (m = {self.config.hnsw_m}, ef_construction = {self.config.hnsw_ef_construction})
    """
    await conn.execute(index_sql)
    await conn.execute(f"SET hnsw.ef_search = {self.config.hnsw_ef_search}")

# Intelligent query optimization with execution planning
async def optimize_query(self, embedding, threshold, limit, exclude_ids):
    plan = await self._analyze_query_requirements(threshold, limit, exclude_ids)
    
    if plan.use_index:
        # Use index hints for optimal performance
        query = "SELECT /*+ IndexScan(e idx_idea_embeddings_hnsw_optimized) */ ..."
    else:
        # Use parallel sequential scan for large result sets
        query = "SELECT ... FROM idea_embeddings e /*+ PARALLEL(e, 2) */ ..."
    
    return query, params, plan
```

**Performance Improvements:**
