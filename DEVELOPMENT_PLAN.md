# Development Plan

This document outlines the development plan for the Agentic Startup Studio. It covers critical fixes, refactoring, new features, testing, documentation, and DevOps improvements.

## Critical Fixes

- [ ] **Agent Environment Setup:** Resolve underlying environment issues preventing `python`, `uv`, and `pytest` commands from executing within the agent's context. This is crucial for automated development tasks.
- [ ] **Formal Security Audit:** Conduct a comprehensive security audit of the codebase using automated tools (e.g., Bandit) and manual review to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
- [ ] **Production Secrets Management:** Implement and enforce a robust secrets management solution for production environments, ensuring no sensitive information is hardcoded or exposed via environment variables.

## High-value Refactors & Performance Wins

- [ ] **Performance Benchmarking Implementation:** Actively implement and regularly run the `scripts/performance_benchmark.py` suite, and analyze its outputs to identify and address performance bottlenecks.
- [ ] **Database Query Optimization:** Analyze and optimize slow-running database queries across all modules, and add appropriate indexes where necessary to improve data retrieval efficiency.
- [ ] **Core Services Modularity:** Further refactor core services in the `core/` directory to enhance modularity, reduce inter-dependencies, and improve code reusability.

## Feature Roadmap

- [ ] **Advanced Idea Analysis:** Integrate and fine-tune more sophisticated NLP models for deeper market trend analysis, competitive landscape assessment, and predictive analytics on idea viability.
- [ ] **Expanded Multi-agent Workflows:** Develop and integrate additional `crewai` and `langgraph` workflows for automated research, marketing campaign generation, and initial development scaffolding.
- [ ] **Robust Web Interface:** Enhance the Streamlit web interface to support full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for ideas, and integrate with other pipeline functionalities.
- [ ] **New Tool Integrations:** Integrate with additional external APIs and tools for specialized functions like social media monitoring, comprehensive patent searches, and financial market data analysis.

## Testing & QA Expansion

- [ ] **Achieve 90% Test Coverage:** Systematically increase unit, integration, and end-to-end test coverage to achieve and maintain a minimum of 90% across the entire codebase.
- [ ] **Comprehensive End-to-End Testing:** Expand the existing end-to-end test suite to cover all critical user journeys and edge cases within the idea processing pipeline.
- [ ] **Property-Based Testing Expansion:** Apply property-based testing (using Hypothesis) to other critical data models and complex validation logic beyond the `Idea` models.
- [ ] **Dedicated Compliance Test Suite:** Develop a comprehensive test suite specifically for regulatory compliance (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR, WCAG), including automated checks and reporting.

## Docs & Knowledge-sharing

- [ ] **Comprehensive API Documentation:** Ensure all API endpoints (especially FastAPI) have detailed in-code documentation, including descriptions, parameters, response schemas, and examples.
- [ ] **ADR Process Enforcement:** Actively use the Architectural Decision Record (ADR) process for all significant architectural choices, ensuring decisions are well-documented and traceable.
- [ ] **Onboarding Guide Enhancement:** Continuously update and expand the `docs/onboarding_guide.md` with new setup steps, common pitfalls, and best practices for new developers.
- [ ] **Specs and Pseudocode Alignment:** Review and update all existing specification and pseudocode documents in the `docs/` directory to ensure they accurately reflect the current implementation.

## ⚙️ Dev Ops / CI-CD / infra work

- [ ] **Full Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Transition from `docker-compose` to a more robust IaC solution (e.g., Terraform, Pulumi) for managing all development, staging, and production infrastructure.
- [ ] **Dedicated Staging Environment:** Establish and maintain a dedicated staging environment that closely mirrors the production setup for thorough testing and validation before deployments.
- [ ] **Advanced Continuous Deployment:** Enhance the CI/CD pipeline with advanced deployment strategies such as automated rollbacks, canary deployments, and blue/green deployments.
- [ ] **Comprehensive Monitoring & Alerting:** Implement detailed monitoring for all services (application, database, external APIs) with actionable alerts, dashboards, and log aggregation.
