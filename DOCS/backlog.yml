    WSJF Score = (Business Value + Time Criticality + Risk Reduction) / Effort
    - Business Value (1-13): Impact on user experience, system functionality, revenue potential
    - Time Criticality (1-13): Urgency based on dependencies, security risks, blocking factors  
    - Risk Reduction (1-13): Reduces technical debt, security vulnerabilities, operational risk
    - Effort (1-13): Development complexity, time investment, resource requirements
