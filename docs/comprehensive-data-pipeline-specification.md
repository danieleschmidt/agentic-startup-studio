- Impact: Difficult to identify performance regressions
- Resolution: Establish baseline metrics during initial deployment

### 9.3 Inconsistencies Found

**Inconsistency 1: Timeout Values**
- Architecture doc suggests 4-hour pipeline timeout
- Pseudocode shows 30-minute (1800s) timeout
- Resolution: Align timeout values or document variance rationale

**Inconsistency 2: Quality Gate Thresholds**
- Some documents show 0.8 funding threshold
