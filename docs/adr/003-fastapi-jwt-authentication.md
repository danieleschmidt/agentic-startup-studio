# ADR-003: FastAPI with JWT Authentication and Rate Limiting

## 1. Title

Implementation of FastAPI with JWT Authentication and Comprehensive Rate Limiting

## 2. Status

Accepted

## 3. Context

The Agentic Startup Studio requires a production-ready API gateway that provides:
- Secure authentication and authorization for all endpoints
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse and control costs
- High-performance API responses (<200ms)
- Comprehensive audit logging for security compliance
- Developer-friendly API documentation and testing

Security requirements:
- Zero-trust architecture with authentication on all endpoints
- JWT-based stateless authentication for scalability
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for different user types
- Rate limiting per user and globally to prevent abuse
- Comprehensive request/response logging for audit trails

## 4. Decision

We have implemented **FastAPI with JWT authentication and multi-layered rate limiting** with the following architecture:

### Authentication Strategy
- **JWT Tokens**: Stateless authentication with configurable expiration
- **Secret Management**: Secure token signing with environment-based secrets
- **Middleware**: Authentication middleware for all protected endpoints
- **Role-Based Access**: User roles (admin, user, readonly) with endpoint permissions

### Rate Limiting Implementation
- **Global Rate Limits**: System-wide request throttling
- **Per-User Limits**: Individual user quotas and burst allowances
- **Endpoint-Specific Limits**: Different limits for expensive operations
- **Cost-Based Limiting**: AI API usage tracking and budget enforcement

### Security Features
- **CORS Protection**: Configured cross-origin request policies
- **Request Validation**: Pydantic-based input validation and sanitization
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive request/response logging with user context
- **Error Handling**: Secure error responses without information disclosure

### Performance Optimizations
- **Async Processing**: Full async/await for non-blocking operations
- **Connection Pooling**: Database connection optimization
- **Response Caching**: Caching for expensive read operations
- **OpenTelemetry**: Distributed tracing for performance monitoring

## 5. Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Security**: Comprehensive authentication and authorization coverage
- **Performance**: <200ms API responses with async processing
- **Scalability**: Stateless JWT authentication enables horizontal scaling
- **Developer Experience**: Auto-generated OpenAPI documentation and testing UI
- **Compliance**: Comprehensive audit logging for security requirements
- **Cost Control**: Rate limiting prevents budget overruns from abuse
- **Monitoring**: Built-in metrics and tracing for operational visibility

### Negative Consequences
- **Token Management**: JWT expiration requires token refresh handling
- **State Complexity**: Rate limiting state requires Redis or in-memory storage
- **Secret Rotation**: JWT signing key rotation requires careful deployment
- **Debugging Complexity**: Distributed tracing adds operational overhead
- **Rate Limit Tuning**: Requires ongoing optimization of rate limit parameters

## 6. Alternatives

### Django REST Framework
- **Rejected**: Higher overhead, less async support
- **Issues**: Monolithic framework, slower performance

### Flask with Extensions
- **Rejected**: Manual configuration overhead, less built-in security
- **Issues**: Requires multiple extensions for production features

### Express.js/Node.js
- **Rejected**: Team expertise in Python, ecosystem alignment
- **Issues**: Different runtime, additional learning curve

### Basic HTTP Authentication
- **Rejected**: Less secure, no token expiration, stateful
- **Issues**: Credentials sent with every request, session management complexity

### OAuth 2.0 with External Provider
- **Rejected**: Additional external dependency, vendor lock-in
- **Issues**: Network dependency, complex token exchange flows
