# ADR-005: Checkpoint Execution Strategy for SDLC Implementation

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The Terragon SDLC implementation requires a systematic approach to handle GitHub App permission limitations while ensuring reliable progress tracking and comprehensive coverage of all SDLC components.

## Decision
We will use a checkpoint-based execution strategy with branch-per-checkpoint implementation and comprehensive documentation for manual setup requirements.

### Checkpoint Structure
Each checkpoint follows a standardized structure:
- **Clear Scope**: Specific deliverables and success criteria
- **Permission Assessment**: Document GitHub permissions required
- **Implementation Plan**: Step-by-step execution approach
- **Validation Criteria**: Success verification requirements
- **Branch Strategy**: Separate branch per checkpoint for isolation

### Error Handling Strategy
1. **Permission Errors**: Document required permissions and provide manual setup instructions
2. **Dependency Conflicts**: Preserve existing configurations and provide migration paths
3. **Large Changes**: Commit frequently with descriptive messages and immediate pushes

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Risk Mitigation**: Isolated changes reduce blast radius of issues
- **Progress Tracking**: Clear milestones with validation gates
- **Documentation Quality**: Comprehensive setup instructions for manual steps
- **Rollback Capability**: Easy revert of individual checkpoints if needed

### Negative
- **Branch Complexity**: Multiple branches require careful management
- **Sequential Dependencies**: Some optimizations could be done in parallel
- **Documentation Maintenance**: Extensive manual setup documentation required

## Implementation Guidelines

### Branch Naming Convention
- Format: `terragon/checkpoint-N-description`
- Examples: 
  - `terragon/checkpoint-1-foundation`
  - `terragon/checkpoint-2-devenv`
  - `terragon/checkpoint-3-testing`

### Commit Message Format
- Format: `{type}: {description}`
- Examples:
  - `docs: establish project foundation and community files`
  - `feat: setup development environment and code quality tools`
  - `test: establish comprehensive testing infrastructure`

### Validation Requirements
Each checkpoint must demonstrate:
- All planned files created/modified correctly
- No syntax errors in configuration files
- Documentation accuracy and completeness
- Successful commit and push to checkpoint branch
- No conflicts with existing repository structure

### Final Integration
- Create single comprehensive PR titled: `ðŸš€ Complete SDLC Implementation (Checkpointed)`
- Include detailed body with checkpoint summaries
- Link to individual checkpoint branches for detailed review
- Document manual setup requirements clearly
- Provide testing and validation procedures

## Success Metrics
- 8 checkpoints completed successfully
- Zero breaking changes to existing functionality
- Comprehensive manual setup documentation
- Enhanced SDLC maturity score (95%+ â†’ 98%+)
- All configurations syntactically valid and tested
