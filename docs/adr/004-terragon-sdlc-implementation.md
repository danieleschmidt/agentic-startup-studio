# ADR-004: Terragon SDLC Implementation Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The Agentic Startup Studio requires implementation of Terragon Labs' enterprise-grade SDLC practices to achieve production-ready maturity (95%+ → 98%+). The existing v2.0 system already implements significant SDLC practices but needs enhancement to meet Terragon's autonomous development standards.

## Decision
We will implement Terragon SDLC using a checkpoint-based strategy to ensure reliable progress tracking and handle GitHub permission limitations systematically.

### Checkpoint Strategy
1. **Discrete Checkpoints**: Break implementation into 8 logical checkpoints
2. **Sequential Execution**: Complete each checkpoint fully before proceeding
3. **Permission Handling**: Document manual setup requirements when GitHub App lacks permissions
4. **Progress Validation**: Validate each checkpoint before proceeding

### Implementation Approach
- **Foundation-First**: Start with documentation and project structure
- **Build Progressive**: Add tooling, testing, and monitoring incrementally  
- **Documentation-Heavy**: Comprehensive documentation for manual setup requirements
- **Validation-Driven**: Each checkpoint must be complete and functional

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Systematic Progress**: Clear milestones and validation gates
- **Permission Resilience**: Graceful handling of GitHub permission limitations
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All aspects of SDLC maturity addressed
- **Audit Trail**: Complete documentation of implementation decisions

### Negative
- **Manual Setup Required**: Some workflows require manual creation by repository maintainers
- **Checkpoint Dependencies**: Sequential nature may slow parallel development
- **Documentation Overhead**: Extensive documentation requirements

## Implementation Details

### Checkpoint Priorities
- **HIGH**: Foundation, Development Environment, Testing, Workflow Documentation
- **MEDIUM**: Build & Containerization, Monitoring, Metrics & Automation  
- **LOW**: Integration & Final Configuration

### Success Criteria
- All 8 checkpoints completed with validation
- Comprehensive documentation for manual setup requirements
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Enhanced SDLC maturity (95%+ → 98%+)

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Monolithic Implementation**: Single large change - rejected due to complexity
2. **Feature-Based Approach**: Organize by features rather than infrastructure - rejected due to permission constraints
3. **Direct Workflow Creation**: Attempt to create workflows directly - not possible due to GitHub App permissions
