# ADR-001: Multi-Agent AI Architecture with LangGraph

## 1. Title

Adoption of Multi-Agent AI Architecture using LangGraph for Startup Validation Pipeline

## 2. Status

Accepted

## 3. Context

The Agentic Startup Studio requires sophisticated AI-driven validation of startup ideas through multiple specialized analysis phases: evidence collection, market research, pitch deck generation, and investor evaluation. Traditional monolithic AI approaches lack the modularity and specialization needed for complex, multi-step validation workflows.

Key requirements:
- Specialized agents for distinct validation phases
- State management across complex workflows
- Error handling and recovery between agent interactions
- Scalable orchestration of AI tasks
- Cost control and budget monitoring across multiple AI services

## 4. Decision

We have adopted a **multi-agent architecture** using LangGraph for workflow orchestration with the following design:

### Core Components
- **LangGraph State Machine**: Manages workflow state and agent transitions
- **Specialized Agents**: Domain-specific AI agents for evidence collection, research, pitch generation
- **Agent Orchestrator**: Coordinates agent execution and handles failures
- **Budget Sentinel**: Monitors and enforces cost limits across all agents

### Agent Specialization
- **Evidence Collector**: Web research and data validation
- **Pitch Deck Generator**: Business plan and presentation creation  
- **Investor Reviewer**: Funding viability assessment
- **Campaign Generator**: Marketing and growth strategy

### Workflow Management
- Event-driven state transitions through LangGraph
- Asynchronous processing with circuit breakers
- Comprehensive error handling and retry logic
- Real-time cost tracking and budget enforcement

## 5. Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Modularity**: Each agent can be developed, tested, and deployed independently
- **Specialization**: Agents optimized for specific domains improve output quality
- **Scalability**: Parallel agent execution improves throughput
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns simplifies debugging and updates
- **Cost Control**: Granular budget monitoring prevents overruns
- **Fault Tolerance**: Agent failures don't cascade through entire pipeline

### Negative Consequences
- **Complexity**: Multi-agent coordination increases system complexity
- **Latency**: Agent handoffs may introduce processing delays
- **State Management**: Requires careful orchestration of shared state
- **Resource Usage**: Multiple agent instances increase memory footprint
- **Debugging**: Distributed failures harder to trace and diagnose

## 6. Alternatives

### Single Monolithic Agent
- **Rejected**: Lacks specialization and modularity
- **Issues**: Difficult to optimize for specific validation phases

### Microservices with REST APIs
- **Rejected**: HTTP overhead and network latency concerns
- **Issues**: Complex service discovery and state synchronization

### Function-Based Pipeline
- **Rejected**: Limited error handling and state management
- **Issues**: No framework for complex workflow orchestration

### CrewAI Framework
- **Considered**: Good multi-agent capabilities
- **Rejected**: Less mature than LangGraph, limited workflow control
