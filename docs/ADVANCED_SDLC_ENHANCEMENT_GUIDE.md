    patterns: ["pytest*", "coverage*", "factory-boy"]
  security-dependencies:
    patterns: ["bandit*", "safety", "cryptography"]
```

### 3. Comprehensive Security Audit (`security-audit.yml`)

**Multi-layered Security**:
- **Vulnerability scanning** with Safety and Bandit

- **Multi-environment deployment** (staging → production)
- **Container building and publishing** to GHCR
- **Deployment validation** with comprehensive health checks
- **Automated rollback** capabilities

**Release Flow**:
```yaml
# Pre-release validation
pre-release-validation → semantic-release → container-release → 
deploy-staging → deploy-production → post-release
```

### 6. Production Deployment Validator (`validate_deployment.py`)

**Comprehensive Validation Suite**:
- **Health endpoint verification** with response time validation
- **Database connectivity** and migration status checks
- **Redis connectivity** and performance validation
- **Authentication system** verification
- **Security headers** compliance checking
- **Monitoring integration** validation

**Advanced Checks**:
```python
async def validate_performance(self):
    # Test 10 concurrent requests
    responses = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    successful_responses = sum(1 for r in responses if r.status == 200)
    
    if successful_responses < 8:  # Allow 2 failures out of 10
        raise Exception(f"Only {successful_responses}/10 requests succeeded")
```

### 7. Enhanced Semantic Release Configuration (`.releaserc.js`)

**Intelligent Versioning**:
- **Conventional commits** with custom release rules
- **Automated changelog** generation with categorization
- **Multi-branch support** (main, dev, release/*)
- **Asset publishing** to GitHub releases
- **Version synchronization** across project files

**Release Rules**:
```javascript
releaseRules: [
  { type: 'feat', release: 'minor' },
  { type: 'fix', release: 'patch' },
  { scope: 'security', release: 'patch' },
  { breaking: true, release: 'major' }
]
```

# Re-run failed jobs
gh run rerun <run-id> --failed
```

**2. Security Scan Failures**
```bash
# Review security report
gh run download <run-id> -n security-reports

# Check specific vulnerability

# Review benchmark results
gh run download <run-id> -n benchmark-results

# Compare with baseline
python scripts/performance_benchmark.py --compare
```

**4. Deployment Validation Failures**

# Review specific validation
cat deployment_validation_report.json | jq '.results[]'
```
