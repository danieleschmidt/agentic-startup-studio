## Performance Optimization Recommendations

### Database Optimization

1. **Connection Pooling**: Increase max connections to 25 for high-load scenarios
2. **Indexing**: Add composite indexes on (status, category, created_at)
3. **Query Optimization**: Use prepared statements for repeated queries
4. **Caching**: Implement Redis cache for frequently accessed ideas

### API Performance

1. **Rate Limiting**: Implement exponential backoff for API calls
2. **Batch Processing**: Process embeddings in batches of 10
3. **Async Processing**: Use async/await for all I/O operations  
4. **Circuit Breakers**: Implement circuit breakers for external APIs

### Resource Management

1. **Memory Usage**: Optimize embedding cache size based on available RAM
2. **CPU Utilization**: Limit concurrent processing based on CPU cores
3. **Disk I/O**: Use SSD storage for database and log files
4. **Network**: Monitor bandwidth usage during peak processing

### Cost Optimization

1. **Smart Caching**: Cache embeddings and similar results for 24 hours
2. **Quality Pre-screening**: Validate ideas before expensive operations
3. **Batch API Calls**: Group similar requests to reduce API costs
4. **Budget Alerts**: Set alerts at 80% and 95% of budget thresholds

---

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. **Throughput**: Ideas processed per hour
2. **Quality**: Percentage passing each quality gate
3. **Cost Efficiency**: Average cost per successful idea
4. **System Health**: Response times and error rates
5. **User Satisfaction**: Idea approval and advancement rates

### Alert Thresholds

- **Critical**: Response time > 10 seconds, error rate > 5%
- **Warning**: Response time > 5 seconds, error rate > 2%
- **Budget**: 80% of any category budget consumed
- **Capacity**: 90% resource utilization sustained for 5+ minutes
