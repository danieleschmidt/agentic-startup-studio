# Deep Review Development Plan

This document summarizes the development plan generated after a deep review of the current state of the project.

## Immediate Fixes (Week 1)
- Address duplicated service definitions and hardcoded secrets in `docker-compose.yml`.
- Move secrets to environment variables or a secret store, and add container resource limits.
- Fill missing circuit breaker settings noted in infrastructure tests.

## Reliability & Observability (Weeks 2‑4)
- Integrate OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing.
- Add Prometheus metrics exporters and baseline Grafana dashboards.
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for external API calls.
- Create readiness and liveness `/health` endpoints.

## Service Boundary Refactoring (Weeks 5‑8)
- Extract evidence collection, investor scoring, and deck generation into separate services with clear API contracts.
- Set up an API gateway with authentication and rate limiting.
- Expand tests to maintain ≥90% coverage focusing on service interactions.

## Scalability Enhancements (Weeks 9‑12)
- Migrate from Docker Compose to Kubernetes with autoscaling policies.
- Introduce a message queue and implement event sourcing for idea processing.
- Add PostgreSQL read replicas and configure Redis clustering for resilience.

## Advanced Monitoring and Cost Controls (Weeks 13‑16)
- Deploy Grafana dashboards and set up alerting rules for budgets, health, and performance.
- Integrate APM tools such as Jaeger to measure pipeline latency.

## Iterative Improvement & Documentation (Continuous)
- Update the milestone‑driven plan as features are completed.
- Keep the operations manual and architecture docs in sync with refactoring and deployment changes.
